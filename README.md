This was a project assigned to me during my first semester of university. The goal of this project was to practise creating and using classes and objects in java.

This is a tic tac toe like game:
During the setting phase, players take turns placing their pawns on the board. Each player places as many pawns as the size of the board.
During the placing phase, players take turns moving one of their piece to an adjacent square on the board. Pieces can only move one space vertically or horizontally.
The players continue moving their pieces until one of them manages to place all of their pawns in a single row or column. That player is the winner.

Here are the commands to compile and run the programme:

Compilation command: 	Windows:	javac -cp .;stdlib.jar Cyboard.java
			                Linux:		javac -cp .:stdlib.jar Cyboard.java
 
Execution command:	Windows:	java -cp .;stdlib.jar Cyboard
 			              Linux: 		java -cp .:stdlib.jar Cyboard
