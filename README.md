# Cyboard - Strategic Board Game

A Java implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe-like game with advanced movement mechanics, supporting human vs human, human vs computer, and computer vs computer gameplay.

 

## üïπÔ∏è Game Rules

**Placement Phase:**
   - Players alternately place their pawns (X and O) on empty cells
   - Number of pawns equals board size (e.g., 3 pawns for 3x3 board)

**Movement Phase:**
   - On each turn, players move one pawn to an adjacent cell (no diagonals)
   - Goal: Create a complete row or column of your pawns

**Winning:**
   - First player to complete a full row or column wins
   - Game ends immediately when a win is detected
